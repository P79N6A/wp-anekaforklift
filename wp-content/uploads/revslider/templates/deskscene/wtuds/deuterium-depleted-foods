It was therefore postulated that D-depletion would have therapeutic use in patients with cancer and other neoplastic diseases.  – Study the Deuterium content in germinated beans, grains and others.  This week we continue with Phil Escott, a fellow carnivore who dedicates his time spreading the word and saving vegans and vegetarians.  We need to make sure deuterium levels in the body are low and we can do this by eating foods that are low in deuterium and that produce the most amount of deuterium deplete, metabolic water as possible.  With only a small fraction of the deuterium found in naturally occurring water (25ppm as compared to 155ppm) our 25 Preventa deuterium-depleted drinking water is recommended for health conscious individuals, and suggested for use by replacement of the daily normal fluid intake.  Water with a deuterium molecule concentration of 1 to 120 parts per million can be considered deuterium depleted water or DDW.  Due to its atomic mass, the isotope is a better neutron moderator than ordinary hydrogen, and deuterium oxide is used in some nuclear fission reactors, such as the CANDU design.  In this first half the interview we&#39;ll find out what he does, what a low deuterium diet is, the contradiction that is vegan carnivores, and how how to prevent diets turning into cults.  13, No.  Old food is higher in deuterium than young food because it, like us, lose their ability to deplete deuterium with age. The nucleus of deuterium, called a deuteron, contains one proton and one neutron, whereas the far more common protium has no neutron in the nucleus.  In newly formed cells, low levels of oxygen damage respiration enzymes so that the cells cannot produce energy using oxygen.  papers on how having lower deuterium levels promotes health, both through eating a ketogenic diet and drinking low deuterium water.
