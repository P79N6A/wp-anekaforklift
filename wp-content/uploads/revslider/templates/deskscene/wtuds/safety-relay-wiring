Normally it is connected to the frame or to the battery’s negative terminal.  We never sell, share or rent your personal information to any third parties under any circumstances.  Safety Mats: Pressure-sensitive safety relays can be used in conjunction with safety mats to ensure the safety of personnel, and further supplement other safety devices.  In addition to the safety-related advantage of the start-up testing, the traditional 3-relay technology (start relay plus two channel relays) guarantees increased avail-ability of the modules in the operating mode “automatic start”.  The electronic safety relays ESR5 are an important component of the safety equipment.  These seldom go bad.  OFF-delay models are available Incorporates LED indicators for monitoring There are two aspects of safety which concern us in the assembly of electrical equipment and control panels.  Never mix different load voltages through adjacent contacts within the same relay such as for example, high voltage AC (240v) and low voltage DC (12v), always use separate relays for safety.  In the words of the Health and Safety Regulations: the need to use safe working practices and safety equipment to avoid the risk of injury to yourself and to others in the course of your work. 1.
