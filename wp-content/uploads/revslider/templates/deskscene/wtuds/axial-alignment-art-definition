In addition, few people are completely consistent.  Balance in art is one of the basic principles of design, along with contrast, movement, rhythm, emphasis, pattern, unity, and variety. 0 Purpose.  Darioa,b a CRIM (Centre for Research In Microengineering), Polo Sant’Anna Valdera – Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna, Viale Rinaldo Piaggio 34, 56025 Pontedera (PI), Italy In any event, all Greek art and Roman art was created during the period known as Classical Antiquity, which lasted about 1450 years - roughly from about 1000 BCE to 450 CE.

The stones &quot;learn&quot; this state of levity in contrast to their ordinary state of gravity, resulting in a new art form that feels alive with its own individual energy and personality.  The magnitude and direction of the axial load can change from its design value if pump-out vane clearance changes due to wear or is not set within tolerance and if balance holes become plugged with debris.
